# Introduction

This is a web based interactive portal build with data from [Geography of Pakistan](https://github.com/pkgeography) repositories. The data is sourced from official channels where it resides in rigid and non-reusable formats. This makes the access, reusibility and understanding of data very difficult for everyone. The sole purpose of this interactive portal is to showcase that how easier it is to reuse the data if it is available in descent digital formats. This example project also demonstrates better ways of showcasing public data for understanding at ease for everyone.
